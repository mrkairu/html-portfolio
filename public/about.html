<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Kairu 🧠🔧. I touch code sometimes, and it touches back. Sleep schedule: non-existent. Caffeine level:
  dangerously plot-relevant. Currently in a situationship with HTML/CSS, but JavaScript keeps third-wheeling uninvited
  😭. I type semicolons like they're emotional support. VS Code theme darker than my future.</p>

<p>I started learning code because I saw a cool website once and said, "Yeah, I can do that... probably. Maybe.
  Hopefully." Now I'm three hours deep into a tutorial that was supposed to be 12 minutes long, and my brain is doing
  backflips in binary. Do I know what I'm doing? No. Am I having fun? Also no. Just kidding—yes. Kinda. Send help. Or
  snacks. 🍜👨‍💻</p>

<p>Catch me debugging at 3AM like tungtung sahur tungtung sahur 💻😵‍💫. Code lookin like it’s been through 3 wars and a
  filler arc. Every time I press run, the computer starts playing boss music. Button won’t center? That’s a skill issue
  (mine). My codebase is griddy-coded, rizzless, and built on pure delulu. IDE’s throwing errors like it’s mad I’m
  chasing my dreams. But IDC. I’m in my “I will fix this if it kills me (and it will)” era. 💥🔥🧍‍♂️#BuiltDifferent
